Hello, please find below the daily costs for the `{{stackTagName}}` stack.

## Daily costs

| Date       | Cost |
|------------|------|
{{#costs}}
| {{TimePeriod.End}} | {{round Total.BlendedCost.Amount}} |
{{/costs}}

Note: costs are fetched from the AWS Cost Explorer API and may be delayed by up to 24 hours.

Costs are for the whole organization, and they are displayed only if the Cost Allocation Tag `{{stackTagKey}}` has been enabled in your AWS account.

Once enabled, you can also filter costs for this tag using the Cost Explorer AWS UI.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html for more information.
