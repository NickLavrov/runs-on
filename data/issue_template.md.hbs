## Daily costs

Note: costs are fetched from the AWS Cost Explorer API and may be delayed by up to 24 hours. We only display costs associated with the `{{stackTagKey}}:{{stackTagName}}` tag, so currently the costs are for the whole organization, not this single repository. You can also filters costs for this stack using the Cost Explorer AWS UI.

| Date       | Cost       |
|------------|------------|
{{#costs}}
| {{TimePeriod.End}} | {{round Total.BlendedCost.Amount}} |
{{/costs}}

You can close this issue, but it will be reopened whenever an error occurs.
